# What-is-my-tip
The dataset contains information on 1000+ deliveries by 2 individuals who spent a few months working part-time. My intention was to build a predictive model based on the available variables to estimate the tip percent, but as I progressed my analysis I wondered, must I always build a model ? Or can I always build a predictive model ? Check out my journey on realizing a critical fact that every data analyst/scientist must come to terms with - Do not rush into building a model! Sometimes, you have to live with a baseline model.
